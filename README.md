# Sparta Fibonacci Numbers

The task was to develop a set of methods that could generate a set of numbers from the Fibonaacci sequence. It was then expected of me to find the sum of all the numbers in the sequence that were even and whose value did not exceed four million.

Another task requirement expected was for this challenge to be carried out using test driven development.

I went about generating this sequence using an array to hold all the numbers. The sequence was to be initialized using the values 1 & 2. 

## Setup 
- Once you access the GitHub repository you can obtain the files by either taking the repository clone link and running `git clone [insert clone link here]`.
- You can also obtain the files by directly downloading them from GitHub as a zip file.
- The group of files contain fibonacci.rb within the lib folder which can be accessed and changed accordingly to use the methods placed inside. In doing so you can obtain the sum of the fibonacci sequence for the set limit of 4 million or change the limit if wanted. 
- The test are contained within the spec but in order to run the test after entering sparta-fibonacci-numbers folder use the terminal to run `rspec` and the test will be carried out displaying the results.
